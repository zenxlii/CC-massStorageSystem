# CC-massStorageSystem
A personal attempt at creating a Logistics Pipes/Refined Storage/Applied Energistics-like storage system with ComputerCraft.

Current features include:
>A mouse-driven GUI for the client program.

>A search bar for said client program to make finding the items you want easier.

>A (hopefully) well-optimised server program which makes heavy use of parallel.waitForAll() to minimise the amount of ticks needed to do what it has been assigned to do.

>The ability to automatically combine stacks of the same item and condense items such as ingots into their block forms in the background to optimise for storage space.

>Full on-demand autocrafting capabilities (although only crafting table crafts currently have an implementation that can be used).
